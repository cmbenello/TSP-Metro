# TSP-Metro
The goal of this project was to find a faster way to traverse all of the stations of the London Underground than the current record.

Grouping up, my father told me about the Tube Challange, which is where you have to try to visit all the stations as fast as possible. I think this was my first introduction to graph theory, and I have been intrigued ever since then. This is my attempt to produce fast solutions to the problem. 

Recently Google updated how their policy with the Google Maps api so I am temporarily unable to accurately find the overground walking distance between staitons.
