# TSP-Metro
The goal of this project was to find a faster way to traverse all of the stations of the London Underground than the current record.

Grouping up my dad told me about the Tube Challange, which is where you have to try viist all the staitons as fast as possible. I think this was my first introduction to graph theory and I have been intruiged ever seince then. This is my attempt of producing fast solutions to the problem. 

It is missing the data set, and I'll try upload that once I have access to my old computer
But yeah basically, this was the project for my senior year, the report it is based on is linked beow:
